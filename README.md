# Student Table
This is a project I developed using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to create a student table. The purpose of the table is to display important information about the students, including their names, emails, enrollment status, grades 1 and 2, and the average.

## Project Features
### Technologies Used:

- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

### Responsiveness: 
The project was developed with a focus on responsiveness, ensuring a consistent user experience on different devices and screen sizes.
###Custom Design and Logic: 
Both the design and logic of the project were entirely created by me. This project represents my first experience using these technologies together.

### Folder Structure
- `src`: Contains the `Page.tsx` file in the App folder, which is the main component of the application.
- `components`: Includes the following reusable components:
 1. `StudentCard.tsx`: Component to display a student's information.
 2. `Table.tsx`: Component that renders the student table.
 3. `StudentStatus.tsx` : Component to display the enrollment status of the student.
- `data`: Inside this folder is the `Students.ts` file, which contains an array of objects used for the table data.
